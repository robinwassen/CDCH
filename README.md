CDCH
====

CrossDomainCommandHandler (CDCH) is a JavaScript class to make life easier when handling cross domain communication from and to frames.

It provides an easy to use interface to the window.postMessage() method, more info can be found at at the [MDN documentaion - window.postMessage()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage). 

Also contains a small base class called EventObject that enables a JavaScript object to handle events in a similar way to DOM-objects.

It is written in CoffeScript, but no CoffeScript experience is required since compiled JavaScript and examples is included.
